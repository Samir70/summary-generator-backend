Practise project for nest.js, jest and supertest calling the openAI API

## Learning how to do this

I made an account at openAI and asked the following question:

> ```I need to write a backend in nest.js which calls the openAI API and forwards a response. I need to test the backend using jest and suprtest. I have programmed in javascript for a while and used express.js to make backends, but I don't know how use nest.js, jest or supertest. Acting as a tutor, can you please devise a study program which will enable me to do what I need to do as quickly as possible. Include reference to free articles which will help me learn. Thanks in advance.```

(It never hurts to be polite!)

I got this response:

Sure! Here's a study program that can help you quickly learn how to use Nest.js, Jest, and Supertest to build and test a backend that calls the OpenAI API:

Step 1: Learn Nest.js
Nest.js is a popular backend framework for Node.js that provides a modular and scalable architecture for building server-side applications. To get started with Nest.js, you can follow the official documentation and tutorials:

    Nest.js Official Documentation: https://docs.nestjs.com/
    Nest.js Crash Course - Traversy Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Nl9Drs01Ew

Step 2: Understand Jest
Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that provides a simple and powerful way to write tests for your code. Jest integrates well with Nest.js and is the recommended testing framework for Nest.js applications. To learn Jest, you can refer to the following resources:

    Jest Official Documentation: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started
    Testing Nest.js Applications with Jest - Nest.js Official Documentation: https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing

Step 3: Learn Supertest
Supertest is a popular library for testing HTTP APIs, and it can be used in combination with Jest to test Nest.js applications. Supertest allows you to make HTTP requests and assert on the response, which makes it a useful tool for testing API endpoints. Here are some resources to learn Supertest:

    Supertest Official Documentation: https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest
    Testing Nest.js Applications with Supertest - Nest.js Official Documentation: https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing#end-to-end-testing

Step 4: Understand OpenAI API
Since you need to call the OpenAI API from your Nest.js backend, it's important to understand how the OpenAI API works and how to make API requests. You can refer to the OpenAI API documentation for detailed information:

    OpenAI API Documentation: https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction

Step 5: Combine Nest.js, Jest, Supertest, and OpenAI API
Once you have a good understanding of Nest.js, Jest, Supertest, and the OpenAI API, you can start building your backend that calls the OpenAI API and forwards the response. You can use Nest.js to create an API endpoint that makes the API request to OpenAI, and then use Supertest to write tests for that endpoint using Jest.

Here are some articles that can help you further with this integration:

By following this study program and referring to the official documentation and tutorials, you should be able to quickly learn how to use Nest.js, Jest, and Supertest to build and test your backend that calls the OpenAI API. Good luck!
